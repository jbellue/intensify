# Intensify!

For these times where a simple image isn't enough...
<https://jbellue.github.io/intensify/>

## How to use

This is supposed to be straightforward, but here goes

### Loading an image

The last loaded image is stored in local storage, so you can you your settings

* From URL: input your image, and click "get"
* From your computer: click "Browse", "Select File" or whatever your browser decided to call that button

### Settings

#### Scale down

Resizes the image. Won't resize if it's empty.

#### Text

Text to display on the image.

#### Font Size

Select the text size in pixels

#### Intensify Text

Allows to add effects on the text:

* none: no effect
* with the image: the text will move along the image
* shake: the text will shake on the image
* pulse: the text will grow and shrink, pulsating
* pulse and move: as above, but also moves.

#### INTENSITY

Defines how much to shake. 1 will be quite subtle, 20 quite stupid.
